# 🎲 Dicee Game

This is a simple web-based dice game that simulates rolling two dice and announces the winner between Player 1 and Player 2. Every time you refresh the page, the dice images update randomly and display the result.

## 📁 Project Structure

├── dicee.html # Main HTML file

├── styles.css # Styling using CSS

├── script.js # Game logic with JavaScript

└── images/ # Folder containing dice images (dice1.png to dice6.png)


## 🚀 How It Works

- On page load, the JavaScript script generates two random numbers between 1 and 6.
- Based on the numbers, corresponding dice images (`dice1.png`, `dice2.png`, etc.) are displayed.
- The player with the higher number wins.
- If both numbers are equal, the result is a draw.
